        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a 4th-year Political Science and Law and Society major from Chino Hills, California. Throughout my academic journey, I have been driven by a strong desire to understand the intricate systems that govern societies and how the law shapes the way individuals interact within them. My passion for politics and the legal field developed at an early age, inspired by my surroundings and the issues that directly impacted my community. Growing up in Chino Hills, a suburb of Southern California, I was surrounded by a diverse group of people, each with unique perspectives shaped by their cultural and socio-economic backgrounds. This environment sparked my interest in social justice, fairness, and the way public policy can address, or sometimes exacerbate, issues like inequality and access to resources.

Chino Hills is known for its suburban comfort, good schools, and a relatively low crime rate. However, it is also an area that faces a mix of challenges, including the pressures of urban sprawl and the complex interplay between local government, business development, and environmental sustainability. These local dynamics have given me an early glimpse into how political decisions impact the daily lives of individuals, especially in rapidly growing areas. Iâ€™ve always been curious about the balance between development and preserving the values that make a community unique.

My academic interests have naturally led me to focus on understanding the lawâ€™s role in shaping social, political, and economic outcomes. Political Science offers a comprehensive overview of political structures, international relations, and the inner workings of governments, while my Law and Society courses have delved into the intersection of law with society, focusing on how laws are created, enforced, and interpreted in real-world contexts. This dual interest has shaped my understanding of how legal systems work not only as a set of rules but as a reflection of societal values and power structures.

At university, I have engaged in various extracurricular activities that have helped me apply my academic learning in practical settings. For instance, Iâ€™ve worked as an intern with a local law firm, where I assisted with research on cases that involved civil rights violations and environmental law. This hands-on experience has given me a deeper understanding of legal processes and the importance of advocacy, while also allowing me to witness firsthand the challenges that individuals face when they seek justice. Additionally, I have participated in my university's debate team, which has honed my communication and critical thinking skills. Debating issues ranging from constitutional law to international diplomacy has allowed me to develop a nuanced perspective on legal and political matters, particularly on how laws and policies affect marginalized communities.

As I approach my final year of study, I am focused on preparing for a career that merges my interests in law and policy. My goal is to contribute to creating more just, equitable, and informed policies that reflect the diverse needs of society. Whether through working in public service, advocacy, or pursuing a legal career, I am eager to continue learning and growing in the political and legal fields. I plan to attend law school after graduation, where I hope to specialize in civil rights law and social justice, aiming to be part of a movement that ensures everyone, regardless of background, has access to the rights and freedoms they deserve.

In conclusion, my time as a Political Science and Law and Society major has solidified my passion for politics, law, and societal change. My experiences in Chino Hills, combined with my academic studies and extracurricular involvement, have given me the tools and perspective to pursue a career focused on making a meaningful impact in my community and beyond.<br><br>
